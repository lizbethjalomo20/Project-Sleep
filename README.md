## Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset Project
This dataset shows people's various sleep health and lifestyle choices in addition to their gender, age, occupation, and other details.
The reason this project was so fascinating is that it depicts real-life health issues, 
both emotional and physical health, based on all the data that couldÂ benefit someone. 
The sleep health and lifestyle data set contains 374 rows and 13 colums, covering a wide range of variables related to sleep and daily habits.
It includes details such as, gender, age, physical activity, stress level, BMI category, blood preassure, heart rate, daily steps, and the presence or abscence of sleep disorders.
We also included informative questions about the data in our research to observe how different categories are impacted by the outcomes.
